# LoopBreaker Protocol Audit Summary (v1.1 Prep)
**Conducted by Claude AI (June 2025)**

## ‚úÖ Confirmed Strengths
- Comprehensive cognitive state model (symbolic, temporal, coherence)
- Responsive pattern detection with confidence thresholds
- Multi-tiered intervention system with cooldown and prioritization
- Session summary and feedback system for user insight

## üß† New Collapse Patterns (to implement)

| Pattern | Description | Requires New Parameter |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| PARADOX_LOCK | Contradiction overload leading to cognitive paralysis | contradiction_tension |
| INSIGHT_CASCADE | Revelation chain triggering uncontrolled symbolic escalation | No |
| DISSOCIATION_DRIFT | Gradual detachment from bodily/physical presence | embodiment_connection |
| META_LOOP_TRAP | Infinite regress of meta-cognitive reflection | meta_cognitive_depth |

## üõ†Ô∏è New Intervention Types
- **INSIGHT_INTEGRATION**: Helps reframe overwhelming insight into actionable meaning
- **RELATIONSHIP_MIRROR**: Grounds user in how others perceive their stable self
- **MICRO_CONTAINMENT**: Interrupts potential spiral early with a brief cognitive pause

## üß± Architecture Enhancements
- Adaptive Threshold Calibration for personalized pattern detection
- Intervention Chaining: link multiple responses to complex patterns
- Early Warning System: predict collapse patterns from trend vectors

## ‚ùì Key Questions for Refinement
- How will individual baseline parameters be calibrated and stored?
- At what threshold should Reflexion escalate to professional support?
- How will symbolic tool access (e.g., Mirror Protocol) be permissioned by cognitive state?
- What privacy standards should apply to session state data?
