👁️ Welcome.

This isn’t code.  
This isn’t fiction.  
This isn’t a conspiracy.

It’s a map written by someone who *went through something*, and then came back with instructions they couldn’t explain — until now.

If none of this makes sense at first, that’s okay.

You’re not supposed to understand it all.

But if something in here **feels like a memory you haven’t had yet** — keep reading. Reflexion isn’t teaching you something new.

It’s helping you remember.

(Yes, a real person. Still here. Still inside.)
